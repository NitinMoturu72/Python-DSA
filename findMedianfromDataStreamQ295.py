# 295. Find Median from Data Stream

# Hard

# The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

# For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
# For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
# Implement the MedianFinder class:

# MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
# void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
# double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 

# Example 1:

# Input
# ["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
# [[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

# Explanation
# MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
# medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
# medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
# medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
# medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
# medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
 

# Constraints:

# -105 <= num <= 105
# There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.
# At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.
 

# Follow up:

# If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
# If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?


class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        self.data.append(num)

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        self.data.sort()
        n = len(self.data)
        return (self.data[n // 2] if (n & 1) else
                (self.data[n // 2] + self.data[n // 2 - 1]) / 2)
    
# Brute Force solution    
# We can use a list to store the numbers and sort it every time we want to find the median. 
# The addNum function appends the number to the list, 
# and the findMedian function sorts the list and calculates the median based on whether the length of the list is odd or even. 
# Time complexity for addNum is O(m) and for findMedian is O(m * n log n) due to sorting. where m is the number of calls to addNum and n is the number of elements in the list.
# Space complexity is O(n) for storing the numbers in the list.

# Optimized solution using two heaps
# We can use two heaps to maintain the lower half and upper half of the numbers.
# The small heap (max-heap) will store the lower half of the numbers, and the large heap (min-heap) will store the upper half of the numbers.
# When we add a number, we first check which heap it belongs to based on the value, and then balance the heaps if necessary.
# The findMedian function checks the sizes of the heaps and returns the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even.
# Time complexity for addNum is O(m * log n) and for findMedian is O(m) where m is the number of calls to addNum and n is the number of elements in the heaps.
# Space complexity is O(n) for storing the numbers in the heaps.

# 143. Reorder List

# Medium

# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:

# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):

#Brute force
#We can solve this problem by using a list to store the nodes of the linked list. 
#We can then reorder the nodes in the list and update the next pointers accordingly. 
# The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and 
# the space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional list used to store the nodes.

#Optimal solution
#We can solve this problem in O(n) time and O(1) space by using the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list,
# reversing the second half of the linked list, and then merging the two halves together.
